    The Provider VDC API allows for basic CRUD operations of a PVDC.
  title: Provider VDC API

paths:

  providerVdcs:
    get:
      x-vcloud-added-in: 33.0
      tags:
        - ProviderVdc
      summary: Get all provider VDCs.
      description: |
        Retrieve a list of all provider VDCs.
        Results can be filtered by context (_context).
        Supported contexts are:
        DVS (_context==dvs-NN;vimServer.id==urn:vcloud:vimserver:uuid) - |
        Returns all the provider VDCs which are related to the DVS.
        The VimServer is required for this filtering.
        External Network (_context==urn:vcloud:network:uuid) - |
        Returns all the provider VDCs which are related to the external network.
      operationId: getAllProviderVDCs

      description: |
        Get a list of all root resource pools.
        If a resource pool is ineligible, but is in the response,
        this means it has children, which are eligible.
        A resource pool will be ineligible,
        unless the cluster has an ESXi host on it.
        The list will be sorted by name, case insensitive.

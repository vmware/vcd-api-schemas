    The vCloud Director vDC groups API allows for management of vDC groups.
    Once a VDC group is created, user can create universal routers that span those vDCs.

      summary: |
        Sync/repair the vDC group. An example usage is to detect if a vDC still exists/is valid.
        If an Org vDC referenced by the VDC group is deleted or if it is not participating in universal networking,
        it's status will be updated to OBJECT_NOT_FOUND and the vdc group will be marked as NOT_REALIZED.
        If the vDC group has universalNetworkingEnabled set to true, this will also initiate a sync of associated router, if any.
        The router entities like egress points and universal routes will also be marked as NOT_REALIZED
        if they reference the removed Org vDC.

      Collection of paging-related metadata to be included by composition via allOf. This type
      should be included in pageable responses to avoid duplicating these common properties. It
      is intended to be included by composition rather than inheritance. Because of this, it has
      no discriminator and should be embedded via allOf. See QueryResults for a reference usage.

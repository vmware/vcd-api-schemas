        Get all Org vDC networks. If "orgVdc" property is not specified in the filter, then user
        must have the rights to view all the vDCs within an organization in order to see all the networks in the organization.
        Results can be filtered on id, name and gateway (subnets.values.gateway). Each network record returned in response
        will contain information about just primary subnet. All the subnets of the network can be retrieved via individual
        network retrieval request.

      The possible allocation types for allocated network address.
      VM_ALLOCATED means that the IP address is allocated by a VM,
      NAT_ROUTED means that the IP address is used in a NAT routed environment and
      VSM_ALLOCATED means that the IP address is allocated to an NSX edge gateway interface.

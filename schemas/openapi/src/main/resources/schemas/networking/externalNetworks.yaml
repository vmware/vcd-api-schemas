    API for management of external networks. An external network provides the
    interface to the Internet for virtual machines connected to external
    organization vDC networks.
  version: "1.0"
  title: External Networks API

paths:

  externalNetworks:
    get:
      x-vcloud-added-in: 32.0
      x-vcloud-multisite: true
      tags:
      - externalNetworks
      summary: Get all external networks.
      description: |
        Get all external networks. Results can be filtered by id, name,
        backing type (networkBackings.values.backingType) and context (_context).
        Supported contexts are:
        Provider vDC ID (_context==providerVdcId) - |
        Returns all the external networks which are available to a specific Provider vDC.
        Org vDC ID (_context==orgVdcId) - |
        Returns all the external networks which are available to a specific Org vDC.
        vCenter ID And Resource Pool Moref (_context==vCenterId;_context==rpMoref) - |
        Returns all the external networks accessible to a given vCenter resource pool.
        Org vDC ID And Edge Deployment Mode (_context==orgVdcId;_context==anEdgeDeploymentMode) - |
        Returns all the external networks to which an edge gateway can connect. Edge Deployment Mode can be
        'standaloneEdgeDeployment' or 'haEdgeDeployment'. Deployment mode specifies whether to use both primary
        edge cluster and secondary edge cluster or just primary edge cluster to determine external network accessibility.
        Edge clusters are determined via vDC Network Profile for input Org vDC.

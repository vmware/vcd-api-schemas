      description: |
        Get all firewall groups. Results can be filtered by name and context (_context).
        Supported contexts are:
        Edge Gateway ID (_context==edgeGatewayId) - |
        Returns all the firewall groups which are available to the specific edge gateway.
        Network provider ID (_context==networkProviderId) - |
        Returns all the firewall groups which are available under a specific network provider. This context requires system admin privilege.

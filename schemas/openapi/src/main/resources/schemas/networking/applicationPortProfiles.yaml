    An API for managing Application Network Port Profiles. Application Port Profiles can be used when defining NAT and Firewall rules to restrict
    the traffic to certain ports and protocols. These are available only to an Org vDC that is backed by NSX-T.
  version: "1.0"

      description: |
        Retrieves all Application Port Profiles. This includes user-defined profiles and default system profile.
        Supported contexts are:
        Org vDC ID (_context==orgVdcId) - |
        Returns all the application port profiles which are available to a specific Org vDC.
        Network provider ID (_context==networkProviderId) - |
        Returns all the application port profiles which are available under a specific network provider.

    An API for managing Network Pools. A network pool is a group of undifferentiated networks
    that is available for use within an organization vDC to create vApp networks
    and certain types of organization vDC networks.

      summary: Get summary of all the Network Pools in the system.
      description: |
        Retrieves summary of all Network Pools in the system.
        Results can be filtered by context (_context).
        Supported contexts are:
        Provider vDC ID (_context==providerVdcId) - |
        Returns all the network pools which are available to a specific Provider vDC.
        Org vDC ID (_context==orgVdcId) - |
        Returns all the network pools which are available to a specific Org vDC.
        Virtual Center ID (managingOwnerRef.id==vcId) + Resource Pool Moref (_context==moref) - |
        Returns all the network pools which are related to a specific Resoure Pool.

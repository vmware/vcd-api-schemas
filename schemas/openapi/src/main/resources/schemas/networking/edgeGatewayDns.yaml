          Whether there is an SNAT rule exists for the DNS forwarder or not. In NAT routed environments, an SNAT rule is required for the Edge DNS forwarder to send
          traffic to an upstream server. In fully routed environments, this is not needed if the listener IP is on an advertised subnet. If the Edge Gateway has a
          dedicated external network and the listener IP has been changed, there will not be an SNAT rule for the DNS forwarder. In all other cases the SNAT rule will
          exist.

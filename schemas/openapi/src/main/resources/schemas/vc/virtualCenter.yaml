    The Virtual Center API allows for basic CRUD operations of a VC.
  title: Virtual Center API

paths:
  rootResourcePools:
    get:
      x-vcloud-added-in: 33.0
      tags:
        - VirtualCenter
      summary: Get resource pools of a VC
      description: |
        Get a list of all root resource pools.
        If a resource pool is ineligible, but is in the response,
        this means it has children, which are eligible.
        A resource pool will be ineligible,
        unless the cluster has an ESXi host on it.
        The list will be sorted by name, case insensitive.
